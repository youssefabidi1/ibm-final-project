This is the final project within the course, "Developing AI Applications with Python and Flask" in the IBM Full Stack Software Developer Certificate. The objective of this project is to develop an AI-based Flask Web Application which will allow a user to provide a text string as input and receive a response from the AI which will tell the user what emotion is being conveyed in that text string.
